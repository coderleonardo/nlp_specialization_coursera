### Course 02 - NLP with Probabilistic Models

#### Week 01 - Autocorrect 
In this week we talk about Autocorrect models. The main goal of this week was construct a Autocorrect model using probabilistic concepts such as Bayes Rule:

$$P(c|w) = \frac{P(w|c)\times P(c)}{P(w)} $$

The main steps for building an autocorrect model are
- Process the data to create the vocabulary used to make the predictions
	- Count frequency
	- Get probabilities of each word in the vocabulary
- String manipulation for create the suggestion words used by the Autocorrect model
	- Insert letter
	- Delete letter
	- Replace letter 
	- Switch letter
- Possible single and double edits on a string input, which contains the possible correction suggestions for the string used as input
- Suggest spelling suggestions
- **Minumum Edit Distance** to evaluate the similarity between two strings and find the shortest path to go from the source word to the target word
	- Dynamic programming
